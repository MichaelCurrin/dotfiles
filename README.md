[.gitconfig.toml](/.gitconfig.toml) | Global git config values for `~/.gitconfig`. A user-wide config known to git.

## Background

Let me give you an idea of what development I do on a daily basis. You'll see the configs fit into these areas.

I am a professional programmer. I use both Bash and ZSH on both macOS and Linux laptops.

I program in Python and JavaScript mostly, with some shell scripting to setup and run things. I dabble in Deno, NPM, Go, Rust, Ruby and other tools and languages. I need to make sure these are installed and configured properly.

I use git and GitHub daily for most of my projects.

I love automation and shortcuts - so I have a lot of shell aliases and git aliases to share.
