> Samples from my shell configs for Bash/ZSH and macOS/Linux

## Background

I am a professional programmer that uses Bash and ZSH. 

I program in Python and JavaScript and I dabble in Deno, NPM, Go, Rust, Ruby and other tools and languages. I need to make sure these are installed and configured properly.

I also use git and GitHub for most of my projects.

I love automation and shortcuts - so I have a lot of shell aliases a git alises to share.

## Configs

Covered in this project:

### Shell configs

Bash config `~/.bashrc` or ZSH config `~/.zshrc`. See [.shellrc.sh](/shellrc.sh)

Shell aliases for Bash or ZSH. See [.aliases.sh](/.aliases.sh).

### Git configs

Global git config - `~/.gitconfig`. A user-wide config known to git. See [.gitconfig.toml](/.gitconfig.toml).

Global git ignore file - `~/.gitignore`. A user-wide git ignore file which will be known to git if added to to the gitconfig as `core.excludesfile`. See [.gitignore.sh](/.gitignore.sh).
