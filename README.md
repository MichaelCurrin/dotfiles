> Samples from my shell configs for Bash/ZSH and macOS/Linux

## Background

I am a professional programmer that uses Bash and ZSH. 

I program in Python and JavaScript and I dabble in Deno, NPM, Go, Rust, Ruby and other tools and languages. I need to make sure these are installed and configured properly.

I also use git and GitHub for most of my projects.

I love automation and shortcuts - so I have a lot of shell aliases a git alises to share.
