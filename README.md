I created this repo as content for my **Dotfiles** post series on [dev.to](https://dev.to). See [Part 1](https://dev.to/michaelcurrin/dotfiles-to-make-your-shell-awesome-1pa1) of my series.


## Configs

Files covered in this project:

Name                                | Description
---                                 | ---
[.shellrc.sh](/.shellrc.sh)         | Content for Bash config `~/.bashrc` or ZSH config `~/.zshrc`. 
[.aliases.sh](/.aliases.sh)         | Shell aliases for Bash or ZSH. 
[.gitconfig.toml](/.gitconfig.toml) | Global git config values for `~/.gitconfig`. A user-wide config known to git.
[.gitignore.sh](/.gitignore.sh)     | Global git ignore content for `~/.gitignore`. A user-wide git ignore file which will be known to git if added to to the gitconfig as `core.excludesfile`.

BTW I named them with extensions in GitHub, in order to get proper sytanx highlighting.


## Background

Let me give you an idea of what development I do on a daily basis. You'll see the configs fit into these areas.

I am a professional programmer. I use both Bash and ZSH on both macOS and Linux laptops.

I program in Python and JavaScript mostly, with some shell scripting to setup and run things. I dabble in Deno, NPM, Go, Rust, Ruby and other tools and languages. I need to make sure these are installed and configured properly.

I use git and GitHub daily for most of my projects.

I love automation and shortcuts - so I have a lot of shell aliases and git aliases to share.
